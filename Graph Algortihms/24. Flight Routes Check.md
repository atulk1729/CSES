Chain of thoughts that happened while solving the problem:
1. If every node is connected to every other node, they must fall in a same larger cycle since we are talking about directed graphs.
2. If every node is connected to every other node, then if we choose any node $p$ then that node should be reachable to every other node and vice versa, i.e., every other node should be reachable to this node, $p$.
3. Extending point 2, if we want to know whether two other nodes $u$ and $v$ are connected both ways. We can reach from $u$ to $p$ and then from $p$ to $v$. Same logic for the $v$ to $u$ travel.
4. So, we just need to choose one node, say $1$. And confirm that $1$ is connected to all nodes and all nodes are connected to $1$. For first part, we run dfs from $1$ and get the `visited` array. For the second part, we reverse the graph and run dfs from $1$.
5. This also solves the part of finding two nodes such that they are not connected.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;

void dfs(int u, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
    if(visited[u])
        return;
    
    visited[u] = 1;
    for(int v : adj[u]) {
        dfs(v, adj, visited);
    }
}

void solve() {
    int32_t n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<vector<int>> adj(n), rAdj(n);
    vector<bool> visited(n), rVisited(n);

    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        u--, v--;
        adj[u].push_back(v);
        rAdj[v].push_back(u);
    }

    dfs(0, adj, visited);
    dfs(0, rAdj, rVisited);

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(!visited[i]) {
            cout << "NO\n" << 1 << " " << i + 1 << endl;
            return;
        }
        if(!rVisited[i]) {
            cout << "NO\n" << i + 1 << " " << 1 << endl;
            return;
        }
    }

    cout << "YES\n";
}
 
int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t = 1;
    // cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        solve();
    }
}
