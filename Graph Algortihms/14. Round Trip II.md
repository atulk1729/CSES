This is the same as [[6. Round Trip]] where we have to find a back edge at there trace back to get the cycle. Only difference is that the graph is directed so we have to consider scenario where a pre visited node is not connected to current node while finding back edge. In case of undirected graph, every visited node that was seen from another connected node is also connected backwards but not here. So we keep a currentRun set in which we store the nodes that are present in the current dfs run. And we consider a pre visited node as back edge only when it is in the currentRun. Also, we pop the current run element once we have come out of it.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;

void dfs(int u, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int>& parent, set<int>& currentRun, bool& found) {
    visited[u] = 1;
    if(found)
        return;
    currentRun.insert(u);
    for(int v : adj[u]) {
        if(found)
            return;
        if(visited[v]) {
            if(currentRun.find(v) != currentRun.end()) {
                int start = u;
                vector<int> cycle;
                while(u != v) {
                    cycle.push_back(u + 1);
                    u = parent[u];
                }
                cycle.push_back(u + 1);
                cycle.push_back(start + 1);

                reverse(cycle.begin(), cycle.end());
                cout << cycle.size() << endl;
                for(int c : cycle)
                    cout << c << " ";
                cout << endl;

                found = true;
                return;
            }
        } else {
            parent[v] = u;
            dfs(v, adj, visited, parent, currentRun, found);
        }
    }
    currentRun.erase(u);
}

    if(!found)
        cout << "IMPOSSIBLE\n";
}
