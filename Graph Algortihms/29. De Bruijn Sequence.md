The first idea that came in my mind was constructing a directed graph such that a node will have an edge to other in this way: $u = b_1b_2b_3 \cdots b_n$ will have edges to $v_1 = b_2b_3b_4 \cdots b_n0$ and $v_1 = b_2b_3b_4 \cdots b_n1$. When I made that graph I realized that it is a graph which has an Eulerian cycle always. But we need to construct the smallest length sequence that contains all the substrings of length $n$. So a Hamiltonian cycle would do our job. But I have not learned it yet and also saw it takes more time complexity. Then got across this awesome article: [de Bruijn sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence) which talks about a similar graph as I though but it uses the edge weights to construct a graph of length one shorter than $n$ and here we have to find the Eulerian tour which makes the complexity $O(E)$. Below is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#define int long long
using namespace std;

string decToBin(int x, int n) {
    string b;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if(x & (1 << i)) {
            b.push_back('1');
        } else {
            b.push_back('0');
        }
    }
    reverse(b.begin(), b.end());
    return b;
}

int eulerianTour[100000];
int ei = 0;

void euler_dfs(int u, vector<set<int>>& adj, vector<bool>& visited) {
    visited[u] = true;
    while(!adj[u].empty()) {
        int v = *adj[u].begin();
        adj[u].erase(v);
        euler_dfs(v, adj, visited);
    }
    eulerianTour[ei++] = u;
}

void solve() {
    int32_t n;
    cin >> n;

    if(n == 1) {
        cout << "01\n";
        return;
    }

    vector<set<int>> adj(1 << (n - 1));
    for(int i = 0; i < (1 << (n - 1)); i++) {
        int msbFlipper = (1 << (n - 1)) - 1; // 111111
        msbFlipper = (msbFlipper >> 1); //011111

        int v = (i & msbFlipper) << 1;

        adj[i].insert(v);
        adj[i].insert(v + 1);
    }

    vector<bool> visited(n);
    euler_dfs(0, adj, visited);

    cout << decToBin(0, n - 2);

    for(int i = ei - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        cout << ( eulerianTour[i] & 1 );
    }

    cout << endl;
}
 
int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t = 1;
    // cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        solve();
    }
}
```
