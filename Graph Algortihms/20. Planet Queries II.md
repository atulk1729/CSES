The story begins by finding out what a [[Functional Graph]] is and analyzing it's properties to a minute level.
1. A function graph is one where the node, $v$ to which a node $u$ will go is determined by a function, $f$ such that $v = f(u)$.
2. This comes with very special properties:
   * There is one and only one outgoing edge from a node
   * The number of nodes is equal to the number of edges
   * For each connected component in the graph, there is one and only one central cycle and rest all nodes just end up on this cycle
   * The nodes in the cycle can be said cycle nodes and the nodes eventually ending up in a cycle can be said tree nodes.
3. In out problem, the graph is given in the form an array where $t[u]$ denotes where the edge from $u$ goes to, i.e., $u \to t[u]$. So, our case is a functional graph case.

Following is a hurried but understandable implementation for the solution and the important areas have been touched in comments.
