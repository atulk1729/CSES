[[Binary Lifting]] for the win! Earlier I was thinking horribly of constructing a straight path vector and a cycle vector which I would manipulate to get the answer.
But that seemed too ugly. So looked at [[USACO]]'s solution for this and got remembered about this beauty once again. The main areas have been touched in the comments.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
// #define int long long
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int32_t n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;

    // Binary lifting/jumping
    // parent[i][j]: 2^j th ancestor of i
    // parent[i][j] = parent[parent[i][j-1]][j-1] and parent[i][0] = immediate parent
    
    int teleportsTo[n];
    const int maxDepth = (int)log2(1e9) + 1;
    int parent[n][maxDepth];
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        cin >> teleportsTo[i];
        teleportsTo[i]--;

        parent[i][0] = teleportsTo[i];
    }

    // parent array construction
    for(int j = 1; j < maxDepth; j++) {
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i][j] = parent[parent[i][j-1]][j-1];
        }
    }

    while(q--) {
        int x, k;
        cin >> x >> k;
        x--;

        // kth ancestor search using power of binary representation
        for(int i=0; i<maxDepth; i++) {
            if(k&(1<<i)) {
                x = parent[x][i];
            }
        }

        cout << x + 1 << endl;
    }
    
}
 
int32_t main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int t = 1;
    // cin >> t;
    while(t--) {
        solve();
    }
}
```

PS: I had to use array instead of vector because the time constraint was pretty tight and vector was slowing it down for some test cases.
