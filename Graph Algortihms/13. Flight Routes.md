Again a tough one which taught a new insight about Dijkstra's algorithm.
1. The essence of Dijkstra is not the relaxation step. The essence is using the priority queue for traversal. We do the relaxation step just to avoid longer routes from getting stored in priority queue.
2. But here, the problem is to find k shortest routes which will need the other routes (longer than the shortest) to be looked as well. So we remove the relaxation step and put into the priority queue all the routes.
3. We also use a pathCnt array to store the cnt of routes seen till now for that node. If that has become equal to k we don't proceed further. This stops a long loop which could be infinite if there is a cycle in the graph.
4. Very nice problem!
